SUMMARY:Cucumber Community Call
URL:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NbJDkGs4IgDUHDSA8W6WollVL0rnHDCMUxGPrzPPyiI
DESCRIPTION:The purpose of this meeting is to connect core members of the Cucumber community together by sharing what we’ve been working on\, what we’re struggling with\, and offering help to each other.\n\nIt’s a space to raise issues that have significant\, broad or\, strategic impact. When there is a clear consensus\, we will make important decisions quickly but we avoid getting drawn into deep discussions of any particular topic\, preferring to move those discussions to written\, asynchronous communication.\n\nWe build the agenda collaboratively\, and take notes of decisions and actions\, in the Google document.
